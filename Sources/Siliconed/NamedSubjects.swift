///
///   - **The name never reaches the model.** `@alice` becomes "the person in <image1>": the kind and the
///     `<imageN>` label the template already puts in front of each image (Qwen's official edit-prompt
///     rewriter writes it so). A name is a word, and the model reads words as content: "redraw Alice"
///     on a drawing of a woman gave Alice in Wonderland (11/10); `@neo` or `@paris` would leak the same
///     way. A legend after the prompt says what to take from each image. An article the user wrote
///     before the mention is not doubled ("in the @room" → "in the place in <image2>").
///   - **One subject, one or two places.** A subject with two pictures takes two consecutive numbers
///     ("the same person in <image1> and <image2>"); citing it twice does not place it twice.
///   - **Numbered by first appearance**, after the edit's own images when there are some
///     (`first`): an edit's image 1 stays image 1.
///   - **Three images at most per render**, whatever the model reads (it reads four in its card): the
///     product's measured worst case is 1024×1536 with three references (measured on the M1 Pro: 4.76 GB, 0 swap).
///   - **The kind is a closed list**: each instruction is written, and judged by eye, once.
///   - **An unknown `@name` is refused**, never passed through as text: a typo would otherwise render
///     without its picture and nobody would see why.
